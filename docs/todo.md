- lets do a housekeeping pass, clean up the codebase, cleanup warnings, reduce file lengths, improve DRYness, improve maintainability, collapse large structs/objects into clearly named smaller objects, add missing docs, improve symbol naming, find and resolve bugs, improve performance, etc.
lets then write every task you find into @todo.md as a new todo item
