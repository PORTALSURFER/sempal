- lets do a housekeeping pass, clean up the codebase, cleanup warnings, reduce file lengths, improve DRYness, improve maintainability, collapse large structs/objects into clearly named smaller objects, add missing docs, improve symbol naming, find and resolve bugs, improve performance, etc.
lets then write every task you find into @todo.md as a new todo item

- when the playhead reached the end, hide it

- for some samples, the playhead will stop before the end of the sample, at least visually, please audit this.

- add a little dice logo in the toolbar at the top of the sample browser (where the search bar is etc). users can click it to play a random sample, and can shift+click it to toggle sticky random mode.
