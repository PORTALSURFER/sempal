- lets design a smarter context changing ux system which understands the layout, so that alt+arrow key movement will correctly move around the 2d plane based on direction, without hardcoding all this.
the idea to to have contexts chromes, like the sample browser or waveform etc, to navigate these, the user can use alt+arrows.
navigation inside these contexts, like for example, navigating the browser list, the user can use plain arrow keys.

- it should be possible to select multiple samples in the browser and collection items list, and drag drop them all at once to the various drop targets, internal or external
