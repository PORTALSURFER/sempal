# Keys under [categories] become `class_id`s in `labels_weak`.
# Keep these aligned with the classes your model understands (e.g. kick, snare, hihat_open, ...).
#
# Patterns are matched case-insensitively against BOTH:
# - the filename stem (preferred)
# - the full relative path (fallback)
#
# Matching is word-based after normalization:
# - separators like _, -, ., / become spaces
# - CamelCase and digit boundaries become spaces (Kick10 -> "kick 10", BangKick -> "bang kick")
